# coronavirus-cases-tracker
This application tracks and reports the total number of cases reported all around the globe of this disease and there is a breakdown based on the state and the country.

And we can check the total number of cases that are being reported so far from the beginning and then it also tracks the changes since the last day.
That means we view how many new cases have been reported today.

And this application is built with HTML responses, not REST APIs.
Therefore, Thymeleaf (which is server-side java template engine for both web and standalone applications) is used as the templating library to render HTML.
(If we use template engine like thymeleaf, we donâ€™t have to use JavaScript to write front-end)
